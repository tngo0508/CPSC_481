While playing the game, AI player spaceship will move on its own. If it is in a dangerous situation, consider using one of three symbol/drawing above. <br>
### ***Note: Depending on each computer resolution, the default symbols may or may not work on your screen when you try to draw a symbol. 
Keep in mind that default resolution screen is 1680 x 1050. If symbols are drawn, nothing is happening. Probably you need to train the AI again to learn your drawing. This happens because creators' drawing, say a circle, will be lightly different from your drawing circle. <br>

+ Training: start train AI to learn your drawing/symbols <br>
The drawing should be done in the correct order that is ABC-ABC-ABC-...-ABC. It takes AI 30 times of drawing to learn. So, each symbol is taking 10 times. <br>
A: first symbol <br>
B: second symbol <br>
C: third symbol <br>
### **A,B,C are not neccessary to be the same as the 3 default-saving symbols** <br>
When you hit the 30th drawing, the game will pause about 1min30s - 2min00s for the AI to do calculation and prediction. Don't close the game!!! <br>
